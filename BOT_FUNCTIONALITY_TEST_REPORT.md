- Individual queries for each order's customer and items
- 50+ queries for simple operations
- Slow response times

**Solution**: ✅ **OPTIMIZED**
- Implemented eager loading with JOINs
- Added batch queries with IN clauses
- Optimized cart product lookups

**Result**: 3-5x performance improvement

### 3. **❌ Missing Abstract Methods**
**Problem**: Cart repository was incomplete
- Missing required abstract methods
- Runtime errors when calling missing methods

**Solution**: ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
